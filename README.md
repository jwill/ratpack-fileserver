# Ratpack-fileserver

A simple file server using Ratpack and Groovy.

Due to issues with serving files on Netty, which Ratpack 0.7+ uses, this project is locked on 0.2 until the situation improves.

This is a toy file server and is not meant for things that need bulletproof security.

Expect a change to integrate Google+ Sign-In and/or Mozilla Persona for authentication at some point.
